# ART
ART stands for A Reporting Tool.

ART is a lightweight, multi-platform, web application that enables quick deployment of SQL query results. It has features that make it a simple yet effective reporting and business intelligence solution.

Once an SQL query is ready, it can be published through ART in a few minutes. Authorised users can then log in and view the results in the browser.

Some of the features of ART include

* Providing reports via a web browser
* A number of report types e.g. tabular, charts
* A number of output formats e.g. xlsx, pdf
* Ability to have multiple reports in a single page (dashboards)
* Scheduling reports
* Use existing authentication systems e.g. LDAP, Active Directory
* Simple to install, administer and use

A bigger list of features can be found in the [Features](https://sourceforge.net/p/art/wiki/Features/) page.

ART is a Java web application. You can run it on any operating system that has Java, and use any modern browser to view and manage reports.
